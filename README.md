todo list:  
- Maybe add a help formspec page.  
- Add a proper description and co.  
- Output the meassurements in a textarea to copy.  
- Make code more readable.  
- Maybe store the stepcounter in world-/modstorage. (Currently when you leave a meseconometer on and rejoin, the step number becomes very long.)  
- Digiline support?  
- Display real time?  
- Allow to not reset the data every time the meseconometer is activated?  
- Get away from github.  
- Improve this list.
